# Comparing Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Against Common Games
CS541 - Deep Learning final project. Comparing and analyzing the training and results of deep reinforcement learning algoritms

There is very little standardized performance analysis of Reinforcement Learning models, beyond simple comparisons between their theory. Our group analyzed the strengths and weakness of three Reinforcement Learning models by comparing their performance on identical environments. As opposed to analyzing one model on many environments, or compiling previous works on individual model performance, we examined how each model responded to different environments with varying levels of complexity and difficulty.
